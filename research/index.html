                                <p>Having taken classes at CMU's <a href="http://www.learnlab.org/">LearnLab</a>, I recognize Treehouse offers one of the very best e-learning experiences. The masterful use of multimedia elements, the proper segmentation of the educational content and the emphasis on practice come together in a product that's genuinely effective, as attested by the inspiring <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/stories">Treehouse Stories</a>.</p>
                                <p>Here are two ways to continue leading the e-learning space.</p>
                                <h4>Make learning even more personalized</h4>
                                <p><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MOutGGET2VwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=e-learning+design+principles+colvin+clark&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi0rojI6K7KAhXFhQ8KHWgwBxYQ6AEIJTAA">E-Learning and the Science of Instruction</a> emphasizes the importance of personalization in designing effective systems. One effective way to achieve personalization is by using human-like learning agents that encourage students to make progress. Duolingo, an exemplary educational company <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Luis-Von-Ahn/session/27/">with a strong focus on research</a>, uses its lovely mascot as a personal coach to keep students on track.</p>

                                    <img width="700px" class="center" src="../img/research/01.png"/>
                                </center>
                                <p>I see that Treehouse has very clear call-to-action and performance graphics of its own:</p>
                                <center>
                                    <img width="700px" class="center" src="../img/research/02.png"/>
                                </center>
                                <p>...but I miss having a playful coaching character like Duo. Having a tangible agent may spark engagement and learning rates.</p>
                                <h4>Introduce some (light) pressure</h4>
                                <p>Learning at one's own pace feels great, and most Treehouse students are accomplished self-motivators, but everyone can benefit from a slight push to achieve their goals. I'm currently taking a self-paced Coursera course, and for the past three weeks I've noticed they've become a bit more aggressive emailing me about suggested deadlines. Despite having a lot going on at work, I've actually stayed on top of the course more thanks to this!</p>
                                <p>What if Treehouse asked its students for an estimated timeline to complete a particular course, and then reminded the student of his plans every now and then? I think we'd see more students getting great results.</p>
                                <h4>Provide more control to advanced learners</h4>
                                <p>Tracks are a great way to keep students focused on a goal, and provide necessary guidance for novices. However, there's many Treehouse users that are experienced developers looking to broaden their skills. The assumption is that these students change tracks often (I know I do).</p>
                                <p>See the picture below: switching languages in Duolingo used to be buried in a menu. Now it's more exposed, benefitting language junkies. To the right is a mockup of a possible interface that makes it easier to switch tracks. This would be an improvement over the existing solution if this track switching method takes the student right to the course where he left off.</p>
